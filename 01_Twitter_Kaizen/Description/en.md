## Changes:

| Effect                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change TL time from relative to absolute time**                                | **As the name suggests. Relative time is annoying. (e.g., 06:15:03 06/17/24, Mon)**                                                                             |
| **Display time and date in the sidebar**                                         | **You can see it in the bottom right of the taskbar, but it's annoying on the page. Also, I customized the taskbar and the date is a bit hard to see.**         |
| **Restore Twitter (restore icons)**                                              | **Let's reclaim our Twitter! Change the X icon in the top left of the page and the splash screen to a bird. Restore the home and premium icons in the header.** |
| Remove basic borders                                                             | No borders look cooler.                                                                                                                                         |
| Remove borders below posts                                                       | Same as above.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Remove the scrollbar in the header                                               | Just in case for elements that might be added in the future. Also, it looked awkward when the height was low.                                                   |
| Remove "Subscribe to Premium" in the sidebar                                     | Not interested.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Remove "Who to follow" in the sidebar                                            | Never registered from here.                                                                                                                                     |
| Remove UserName                                                                  | Because it became long due to absolute time and looked difficult to read.                                                                                       |
| Change TL width from 600px to 700px, and right sidebar width from 350px to 250px | No need for such wide sidebars. Even this is too big.                                                                                                           |
| Make the status of "Whatâ€™s happening" in the sidebar easier to read              | It was a bit hard to see.                                                                                                                                       |
