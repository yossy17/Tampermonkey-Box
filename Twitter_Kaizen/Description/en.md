# This is a script to improve Twitter display

First post, so a little nervous (｡>﹏<｡)

Future "plans" to add

## Changes:

| Effect                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change TL time from relative to absolute time                                    | As the name suggests. Relative time is annoying. (e.g., 06:15:03 06/17/24, Mon)                                                                     |
| Display time and date in the right sidebar (systemically header)                 | You can see it in the bottom right of the taskbar, but it's annoying on the page. Also, I customized the taskbar and the date is a bit hard to see. |
| Restore Twitter (restore icons)                                                  | Let's reclaim our Twitter! Change the X icon in the top left of the page and the home and premium icons in the header to birds.                     |
| Remove basic borders                                                             | No borders look cooler.                                                                                                                             |
| Remove borders below tweets                                                      | Same as above.                                                                                                                                      |
| Remove scrollbar from left sidebar                                               | Just in case for elements that might be added in the future. Also, it looked awkward when the height was low.                                       |
| Remove "Subscribe to Premium" from right sidebar                                 | Don't care about it.                                                                                                                                |
| Remove "Who to follow" from right sidebar                                        | Never followed anyone from here.                                                                                                                    |
| Remove UserName                                                                  | Because it became long due to absolute time and looked difficult to read.                                                                           |
| Change TL width from 600px to 700px, and right sidebar width from 350px to 250px | No need for such wide sidebars. Even this is too big.                                                                                               |
| Make status "What's happening" in the right sidebar easier to read               | It was a bit hard to see.                                                                                                                           |
